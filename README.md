Introduction to Web Development

## Responsive web design testing

Welcome to the //ShiftClick example site, where all the elements of our Introduction to Web Development course have come together. This page was thoughtfully created by a previous participant to assist others in catching up if they may have missed a day =D.

Most of what you see here is covered in our learning materials, both in the sessions and webinars provided. We understand that learning something new can be challenging, so if you ever find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to reach out to our strong team of mentors who are more than happy to offer their support. You might be surprised to learn that this page was put together by someone who was not long ago a caretaker in local community centers; our courses can truly open up exciting possibilities!

Feel free to explore around! Our sample page provides additional context and even a couple of fun mini-games for you to enjoy.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all our participants, and we hope you find the //ShiftClick experience both enjoyable and enriching. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. 

Happy coding!
