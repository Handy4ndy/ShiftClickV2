        <p>Welcome to the //ShiftClick example site, where all the elements of our Introduction to Web Development course
            have come together. This page was thoughtfully created by a previous participant to assist others in catching up
            if they may have missed a day =D.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most of what you see here is covered in our learning materials, both in our sessions and webinars. We understand
            that learning something new can be challenging, so if you ever find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to reach
            out to our strong team of mentors who are more than happy to offer their support. You might be surprised to
            learn that this page was put together by someone who was not long ago a caretaker in local community centers;
            our courses can truly open up exciting possibilities!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to explore around! Our sample page provides additional context and even a couple of fun mini-games for
            you to enjoy.</p>
        <p>We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all our participants, and we hope you
            find the //ShiftClick experience both enjoyable and enriching. If you have any questions or need further
            assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Happy coding!</p>
